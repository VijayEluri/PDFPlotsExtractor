LIGATURES: Find out, how to treat situations when one glyph represents
   many characters ... hwo is it treated by other solutions ?

OPERATION DISTANCE: It might be useful to add a new distance measure
   based on the distance inside the PDF operations stream. (might be
   useful when for example excluding page template graphics from plots
   in slides)

Text block splitting: Currently there is a global vertical margin
   value which is usually enoug to separate plot captions from the
   rest of the test. This should be replaced by some local proparty of
   text lines -> for example distance bigger than average from last N
   lines.

GUI Parameters: change GUI in order to allow dynamic extractor
   parameters manipulation - this would allow to show how different
   documents behave with different sets of parameters

Parameters: Make parameters serialisable (and deserialisable) to the
   configuration file
